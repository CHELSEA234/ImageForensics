# HiFi_IFDL

This is the source code for image editing detection and localization, as well as the diffusion model attribution. Our work has been accepted by CVPR $2023$, titled as "*Hierarchical Fine-Grained Image Forgery Detection and Localization*". [[Arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.17111.pdf)

### Updates.
- Per many email requests, we release our first version source code for the reference. 
- ~~Apologize that this is not the finalized version code, which will be released soon along with the dataset~~
- Update the inference interface and test.py
- **the dataset and a DAPRA sponsored image forensic demo will be released soon**
- **this github will keep updated, please stay tuned~**

### Quick Usage:
- To create your own environment by:
  ```
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  ```
- Go to this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v07aJ2hKmSmboceVwOhPvjebFMJFHyhm?usp=sharing) to download the weights and put them in `weights`. 
- The quick usage on HiFi_Net:
```python
  from HiFi_Net import HiFi_Net 
  from PIL import Image
  import numpy as np

  HiFi = HiFi_Net()   # initialize
  img_path = 'asset/sample_1.jpg'

  ## detection
  res3, prob3 = HiFi.detect(img_path)
  # print(res3, prob3) 1 1.0
  HiFi.detect(img_path, verbose=True)

  ## localization
  binary_mask = HiFi.localize(img_path)
  binary_mask = Image.fromarray((binary_mask*255.).astype(np.uint8))
  binary_mask.save('pred_mask.png')
```
