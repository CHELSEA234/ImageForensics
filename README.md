# ImageForensics

## HiFi_Net.py
This code implements the Hierarchical Fine-Grained Image Forgery Detection and Localization algorithm described in the CVPR2023 paper. The code provides functionality for detecting and localizing image forgeries.

## interface.py
This code implements the first (input) interface of the application which is an image viewer with drag-and-drop functionality. The application allows users to select and view images, as well as confirm their selection.

## interface2.py
This code creates a second (output) graphical user interface (GUI) to display the final images including one binary mask, detection score, 4 feature maps and one TSNE plot. The GUI loads a user interface file (form.ui) and displays various labels with images.
